# E-COMMERCE
Description: Project Framework is a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to signup and login with regular or third party login/signup via google. As a user you have full Create Read Update and Delete(CRUD) functionality for a project and requirement object. The intent of this application is for the user to create a project and set requirements for the project that are tracked with completed and deadline attributes.

# Install Instructions: 
To use this application simply clone the e-commerce_backend, bundle update, rails db:migrate, rails db:seed and then start your rails server by running rails s -p 3001 in your terminal which will bring you to http://localhost3001. From the root path navigating through the application with the links in the view pages is recommended.

Next you will need to clone the e-commerce_frontend, bundle update and run the npm start command in the terminal. The e-commerce store should default the url http://localhost:3000 where you will be able to interface with the application. Redux is being used to mannage the global state so when you refresh the browser it will reset the default state in the store.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
